                        <p>Since the COVID-19 officially reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019, it has been causing great fear and loss to countries around the world so far. The SARS-CoV-2 virus, known as the pathogen of COVID-19, had completely different characteristics from other known coronaviruses, so it was very difficult to establish the policies against it. In the case of Korea, as a neighboring country to China, the spread of COVID-19 occurred very quickly along with Thailand and Japan. In this presentation, I would like to talk about the role that informatics should play during the outbreak of an unknown disease pandemic like COVID-19. According to the experience of COVID-19 over the past two years, a new disease pandemic can be divided into three major stages. The first step is to recognize which of the many minor diseases become a pandemic. In this step, it is necessary to obtain the characteristics of the unknown disease as quickly as possible from very limited information. The second stage is when countries around the world implement various response policies including lock-down, school closing, gathering limitation, etc. Finally, the third stage is the emergence of numerous mutated viruses due to the phenomenon of immune evasion. In this keynote, I will talk about the efforts of the Korean government in each stage of the pandemic described above from an informatics perspective. I will also discuss what kind of cooperation between countries is needed to effectively deal with the post-COVID-19.</p>
